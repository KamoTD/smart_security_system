# smart_security_system

PROJECT OVERVIEW

The designed system includes both software and hardware applications which play a very important role in the operation of the system. The software system is designed in a form of a web-based application to enable the intended user to be able to access the system remotely and perform operations such as arming/disarming the alarm, view the status of the system, checking the connection speed on the hardware system, view the database & email notifications and also accessing the user manual.

The hardware system is designed in such a way that it is portable and can be put anywhere around the house where the user would like the intruder to be detected. It is used to perform physical operations such as arming/disarming by entering a specific code or pin. The hardware system is able to detect motion, record videos, make a sound alarm and display user input and feedback from the display screen.

The system includes a database to store all the necessary information reported by the system when it is triggered and that information can also be downloaded from the database console for reference purposes.  I have used two notification services which will come in a form of an email and SMS to alert the user whenever there’s intrusion.
